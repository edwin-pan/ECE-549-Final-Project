# ECE-549-Final-Project

Our project is to benchmark the CycleGAN architecture by comparing its performance with the pix2pix conditional GAN (cGAN) architecture on the ApolloScape Autonomous Driving Dataset. Using the Style Transfer capabilities of CycleGAN, we hope to determine whether it is possible to produce semantic segmentation masks for images by training the model on data without explicit correspondence between masks and images. We will then compare the results with the pix2pix GAN model trained on the segmentation dataset
